# Super-Resolution for Image Enhancement

This project implements a hybrid classical image processing pipeline for super-resolution using:
- Bicubic Interpolation
- Iterative Back-Projection
- Wavelet-based frequency enhancement
- Edge-preserving filtering

Dataset used: DIV2K  
Evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM

This was developed as part of CO543 - Image Processing group project.
